# MyKotlinCalculator

## Overview
MyKotlinCalculator is a simple console-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Reflection
Building the MyKotlinCalculator application was a great way to get introduced to Kotlin and see its similarities with other coding languages, like JAVA and Python, while showing its main strength: it's concise and easy to read syntax and its powerful features, like null safety.

Some of the main challenges was ensuring that the application could handle various edge cases, such as division by zero and invalid inputs. This required creating error handling and user prompts to make sure the user enters the correct thing. Near the end I realized that I needed to also account for the case where a customer might enter different cases, so I had to add a function to convert the input to lowercase.

Overall, this project provided a solid foundation for building more complex applications in the future and a useful intro into the intricacies of Kotlin.
